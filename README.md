# Econ Sim

Running this is pretty simple:

`./mkt.sh`

This will generate all the sim results in `simrun/`. All the prices are just thrown in a JS for easy copying elsewhere. If you open the HTML file in `simrun/`, you'll get a graph of the prices along with a moving average. 

## The Results

This sim is very basic. It just has 3 main entities:
- Households, who consume stuff
- Firms, who make stuff
- A market, where the households and firms interact

## My Thoughts

The project is super simple, but even with that, you can see glimpses of how real markets behave. The logic makes it easy for new firms to join the market, but even then, you see monopolistic behavior, you see a price fluctuation around the base cost of the good, and it's just cool to see the way the firms react to the market.
